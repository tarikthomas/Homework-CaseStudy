**Afterpay Case Study - Tarik Thomas**

**Overview and Origin**

Afterpay is an Australian financial technology company operating in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and New Zealand. Afterpay was founded in 2014 by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen. Nick Molnar, a college student at the time, decided to join forces with his then-neighbour, Anthony Eisen, the former chief investment officer, to begin a consumer lending startup. Molnar&#39;s theory behind the startup was that &quot;Millennials have a total aversion to credit [cards]&quot; because they can lead to compounding debt. He built Afterpay as a way for consumers to pay for items in four interest-free instalments. After early success, Afterpay decided to go public in 2016 and raised &quot;$25 million&quot; - according to Forbes. Since then, it has raised over **$500 million** in post IPO funding rounds in 2019 and 2020.

**Business Activities**

After watching the world suffer during the 2008 financial crisis, Millennials became more aware and sceptical of the idea of owning and using credit cards. In a 2016 [Bankrate.com survey](https://www.bankrate.com/finance/consumer-index/money-pulse-0616.aspx), only one in three adults aged 18 to 29 held a credit card. &quot;The financial crisis scarred a generation into not doing stupid things with their finances,&quot; says Matt Harris, a well-known fintech investor and managing director at Bain Capital Ventures. &quot;They&#39;re kind of scared with credit&quot;. At the heart of Afterpay&#39;s success is a tectonic shift in how people shop and spend money. Its purpose-driven mission is to support the financial wellbeing of its customers and achieve fairness and financial freedom for all. So its model is built on trust. It trusts consumers to pay them back, and retailers rely on after pay to drive demand and repeat sales and consumers trust Afterpay because there are no account fees or interest fees. It&#39;s moving from a credit purchase to a clear trust contract seemingly between the consumer and the retailer, making it an honourable promise between people.

Afterpay&#39;s general demographic ranges from 18 to 40-year-olds, with the average user being 33 years old and eight in ten users being female. While already having 3.6 million active users in Australia and Newzealand, Afterpay can expect this number to keep going up. People are turning to other alternatives because of the consistent decline in credit card users over the past ten years. Afterpay&#39;s biggest competitors, the banks, are riddled with mistrust. Faceless banks profit enormously from consumer hubris, interest rates, hidden fees, and fees for no service leading to consumer trust being at an all-time low. Rather than let the customers have the short end of the deal, Afterpay charges the retailers instead. The bulk of Afterpay&#39;s revenue comes from another source—it sets retailers 4-6% of every transaction to offer this service. The retailers are willing to pay this price as, on average, Afterpay increases retailers sales by up to 25%. This reputation and surge and surge in demand from customers (that Afterpay must be in every store) sets it apart from big banks and other &quot;pay later&quot; startups.

**Landscape**

Afterpay finds itself in the lending domain of the financial world. Until a year or two ago, people associated interest-free finance with furniture stores or promotional offers, but companies like Afterpay quickly changed this perception. &quot;Millennials really love our product because they use it as a budgeting tool for buying nice little luxuries or nice little necessities. That&#39;s all about retail. It&#39;s not about finance&quot; - Molnar. After the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a significant drop and decline in the use of credit cards. This decline can be attributed to the fear that millennials gained watching their parents suffer through those tuff times. With the introduction of Afterpay, users no longer have to worry about harsh interest rates or hidden fee&#39;s. The mistrust between Big banks and their customers has led to the rise of Afterpay and many other lending companies such as Beforepay, Zip Money, Klarna, Latitude pay, Humm, and Openpay. As this trend continues, who knows whether banks will still exist in the next 20 to 30 years.

**Results**

Afterpay has grown ultra-fast. The company went from Melbourne startup to global unicorn in just five years. In 2019, the company generated a revenue of over **A$250 million** , and the company is still expanding fast. By mid-June, 55,400 retailers worldwide were using the Afterpay service – including merchants in the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand. And by stealing a march on global competitors, Afterpay has created an Australian fintech with excellent, long-term prospects. Afterpay has revolutionised how lending can take place and has disrupted big banks and the financial industry. Rather than letting customers pay the expense of lending, Afterpay has shifted the bill on retailers allowing for more individuals to be less financially burdened.
